//! A behavior-first Rust port of the Nimbasa City Post Pokemon Champions
//! damage calculator.
//!
//! The JavaScript calculator under `reference/NCP-VGC-Damage-Calculator` is
//! treated as the source of truth. This crate currently implements the
//! Champions stat model and the modern Scarlet/Violet/Champions damage pipeline
//! for the common mechanics covered by the regression fixtures.
